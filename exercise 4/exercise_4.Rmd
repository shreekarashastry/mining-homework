## Clustering and PCA

```{r}
wine = read.csv("wine.csv")
wine$color = wine$color %>% as.factor
wine1 = wine[,1:11]
PCAwine = prcomp(wine1, scale=TRUE, rank=3)

#plot(PCAwine)

#round(PCAwine$rotation[,1:3],3) 

autoplot(PCAwine, data = wine, colour = 'color')

         loadings = TRUE, loadings.colour = 'pink',
         loadings.label = TRUE, loadings.label.size = 3)

wine2 = scale(wine[,1:11]) # cluster on measurables k_grid = seq(2, 30, by=1)
N = nrow(wine2)
k_grid = seq(2, 30, by=1)
SSE_grid = foreach(k = k_grid, .combine='rbind') %do% {
cluster_k = kmeans(wine2, k, nstart=50)
W = cluster_k$tot.withinss
B = cluster_k$betweenss
CH = (B/W)*((N-k)/(k-1))
c(k=k, CH=CH)} %>% as.data.frame
ggplot(SSE_grid) +
  geom_line(aes(x=k, y=CH))
#choose k=10
Clusterwine = kmeans(wine2, 10, nstart=50)
qplot(quality, color, data=wine, color=factor(Clusterwine$cluster))
plot(wine2, col = wine$color)

## Market Segmentation

```{r}
greenbuildings = read.csv("social_marketing.csv") %>% drop_na()
```

## Association rules for grocery purchase
```{r}
groceries_raw = readLines('groceries.txt')
groceries = as.list(strsplit(groceries_raw, ","))
groceries = lapply(groceries, unique)


## Cast this resulting list of playlists as a special arules "transactions" class.
grocerytrans = as(groceries, "transactions")
summary(grocerytrans)

# Now run the 'apriori' algorithm
# Look at rules with support > .01 & confidence >.1 & length (# artists) <= 5
groceryrules = apriori(grocerytrans, 
	parameter=list(support=.01, confidence=.1, maxlen=2))
                         
# Look at the output... so many rules!
inspect(groceryrules)

summary(groceryrules)

## Choose a subset
inspect(subset(groceryrules, lift > 2 & confidence > 0.35))

### started from values near the max, and lowered to have around 5.

# plot all the rules in (support, confidence) space
# notice that high lift rules tend to have low support
plot(groceryrules)

# can swap the axes and color scales
plot(groceryrules, measure = c("support", "lift"), shading = "confidence")

# "two key" plot: coloring is by size (order) of item set ???
plot(groceryrules, method='two-key plot')

# can now look at subsets driven by the plot
inspect(subset(groceryrules, support > 0.035))
inspect(subset(groceryrules, confidence > 0.6))


# graph-based visualization
sub1 = subset(groceryrules, subset=confidence > 0.01 & support > 0.005)
summary(sub1)
plot(sub1, method='graph')
?plot.rules

plot(head(sub1, 100, by='lift'), method='graph')
```
