## What causes what?

1. 

## Tree modeling: dengue cases

```{r}
dengue = read_csv('dengue.csv')
```

## Predictive model building: green certification

```{r}
greenbuildings = read_csv("greenbuildings.csv")

```


## Predictive model building: California housing

```{r}
CAhousing = read_csv("CAhousing.csv")
```

The model does the prediction pretty well. It only got `r abs(as.integer(hotels_final[21, 3]))` predictions wrong in total out of 4999 observations though if you look at each folds individually there is a difference as in sometimes we have negative and sometimes positive values, but in total it all averages out to `r abs(as.integer(hotels_final[21, 3]))`.
